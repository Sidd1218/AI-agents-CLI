🤖 AI-CLI: Your AI assistant in your Terminal
A lightweight and powerful command-line interface for executing AI-powered commands directly from your terminal.

🚀 Features
This tool provides a global ai command that sends your prompts to a configured AI model and streams the response right back to your console.

🌐 Universal Access: Run AI commands from any directory in your terminal. No need to switch contexts.

💬 Natural Language Interface: Simply pass your prompts as you would speak or type them. For example: ai "refactor this python script for clarity".

🐍 Seamless Project Integration: Pipe code directly from your files or standard output into the AI for instant refactoring, documentation, or analysis.

⚙️ Flexible Model Support: Easily switch between different AI backends—whether it's a powerful remote API or a private, locally-run model.
